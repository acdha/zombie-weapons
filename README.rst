Zombie Weapons is a Django project that has just enough features to exercise the features of Amazon Web Services (AWS), yet is simple enough to be easily understood.

If you're new to AWS, you'll need to do a little prep work:

1. Create an AWS account.  You'll want to take a look at the details of the free usage tier at http://aws.amazon.com/free/.
2. Launch an EC2 instance.  Choose the 64-bit Linux instance that is available to the free trial - it will have a star next to it.  Be sure to create a Key Pair so that you can connect to your instance once it is launched.
